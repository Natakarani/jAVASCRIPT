    <h1>promises</h1>
    

        <h3>what is promise</h3>
        <p>promise is a inbuilt constructor of javscript</p>
        <p>a promise object represents a operation which producted or will eventually prodiuce a value,. promises provide 
            a robust way to execute the (posssibly pending) result of asynchronous result
        </p>

        <h3>states of promises</h3>
        <p>there are 4 states</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pending</li>
            <li>fulfilled</li>
            <li>rejected</li>
            <li>settled</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>pending state</h3>
        <p>the operation not yet completed or not rejected (i.e, not yet started) that state we can call it as pending sttae(.then() is going to handle the pending state)</p>

        <h3>fulfilled state</h3>
        <p>operation is successfully completed and promise is fulfilled with response (syntax is .then() for to handle the fulfiled state) </p>

        <h3>rejected state</h3>
        <p>the error will gets due may be any reason (line catch()) (syntax .catch()  for to handle the rejected state)</p>
 
        <h3>settled sttae</h3>
        <p>promise said to be settled that may be rejected or successfull (that state we can call it as settled state). promise is immutable it wont goes to pending sttae again</p>
   

        <script>
            let a=100;
            let promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
                if(a==100){
                    resolve('hi this is new promise response')
                }
                else{
                    reject('promise rejected th task')
                }
            })
            promise.then(function(response){
                console.log(response)

            }).catch(function(error){
                console.log(error)
            })
